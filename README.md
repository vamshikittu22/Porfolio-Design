# Vamshi Krishna | AI-Native Software Portfolio v2.5

An enterprise-grade digital ecosystem designed with **Swiss Minimalist** precision. This project serves as a high-performance technical proof-of-concept, bridging the gap between high-fidelity visual design and algorithmic software engineering.

## 🤖 Interactive AI Assistant
Located in the bottom-right corner, the **VK Neural Assistant** is a context-grounded RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent.
- **Ask anything:** You can ask questions about Vamshi's technical stack, specific project roles, or work history.
- **Grounded Intelligence:** The bot is strictly grounded in the site's JSON data, ensuring it provides factual summaries of experience and skill proficiency.
- **Recruiter Shortcuts:** Use the provided suggestion chips to quickly summarize the profile or dive into backend expertise.

## 🏗️ The Engineering Blueprint: "Inside the Developer's Mind"
Unique to this portfolio is the **Engineering Blueprint** mode—a dedicated architectural case study built directly into the UI. It reveals the exact logic, performance metrics, and development constraints encountered during the creation of this site.

- **How to access:** Click the **"Systems Architecture"** icon in the top right or footer of the live interface.
- **What's inside:**
  - **Interaction State Machines:** Visualizing the magnetic vector math behind the Skill Matrix.
  - **Performance Analytics:** Real-time dashboards showing Lighthouse scores (98+) and bundle distribution.
  - **Recursive Logic:** A breakdown of the Minimax search tree used in the Tic-Tac-Toe engine.
  - **Context Injection:** Documentation on the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline powering the AI Assistant.

## 🏛️ Core Architectural Pillars

### 1. Intelligence Layer (Gemini-Native)
- **RAG-Based Chat Assistant:** Integrates Gemini 3 Flash with a custom **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. It grounds the LLM in structured JSON resume data to ensure 95%+ factual accuracy for recruiter inquiries.
- **Resilient AI Pipeline:** Implements a 4-tier fallback hierarchy to handle API quota locks:
  1. **Session Cache:** Instant hydration for recurring users.
  2. **Live Inference:** Real-time synthesis via Gemini 2.5 Flash for illustrations and greetings.
  3. **Persistent Backup:** LocalStorage snapshots of previous successful generations.
  4. **Physical Fallbacks:** Curated Unsplash assets for zero-inventory scenarios.

### 2. Kinetic Design System (Bauhaus x Futurism)
- **Swiss Precision:** Strict architectural grid utilizing high-contrast typography (Inter/Manrope) and glassmorphism.
- **Inertia Physics:** The UI maps mouse coordinates to hardware-accelerated `rotate3d` and `translate3d` transforms, providing a tactile, biological sense of weight and depth.
- **Procedural Identity:** The Hero features a **Constellation Engine** rendering 550+ technical keyword instances across tiered Z-depth layers.

### 3. Algorithmic Logic
- **Unbeatable AI Engine:** A custom Tic-Tac-Toe module featuring a **Minimax recursive search tree**. It evaluates up to 549,946 nodes to guarantee a non-loss state in "Hard" mode.
- **Magnetic Skill Matrix:** A physics-based interaction model where 40+ technology nodes react to pointer proximity using magnetic displacement formulas and exponential decay.
