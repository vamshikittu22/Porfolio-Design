# Vamshi Krishna | AI-Native Software Portfolio v2.5

An enterprise-grade digital ecosystem designed with **Swiss Minimalist** precision. This project serves as a high-performance technical proof-of-concept, bridging the gap between high-fidelity visual design and algorithmic software engineering.

## 📁 Project Directory & Assets
To manage your downloadable files, use the following structure:

```text
/ (Project Root)
└── public/
    └── assets/
        └── downloads/
            └── Vamshi_Krishna_Resume.pdf  <-- PLACE YOUR RESUME HERE
```

### Direct Download Logic
The application is pre-configured to look for `/assets/downloads/Vamshi_Krishna_Resume.pdf`. 
1. Open the `public/assets/downloads/` folder.
2. Upload/Paste your professional PDF.
3. Ensure the filename is exactly `Vamshi_Krishna_Resume.pdf`.

## 🤖 Interactive AI Assistant
Located in the bottom-right corner, the **VK Neural Assistant** is a context-grounded RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent.
- **Ask anything:** You can ask questions about Vamshi's technical stack, specific project roles, or work history.
- **Grounded Intelligence:** The bot is strictly grounded in the site's JSON data, providing factual summaries for recruiters.

## 📄 Dynamic Fallback
If you choose not to add a physical file, the system utilizes a custom **High-Fidelity Print Engine**. Clicking "Print View" or "Download" (when the file is missing) will generate a pixel-perfect, 2-page executive resume directly from the website's live data.

## 🏗️ Engineering Blueprint
Unique to this portfolio is the **Engineering Blueprint** mode—a dedicated architectural case study built directly into the UI.

- **How to access:** Click the **"Systems Architecture"** icon in the top right.
- **What's inside:** Real-time performance metrics, Minimax decision tree visualizations, and RAG pipeline documentation.
